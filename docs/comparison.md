# Managed Service vs VM Service Comparison

Deploying MySQL in two different ways, on a virtual machine and on a managed Cloud SQL instance. This gave me a clear understanding of how much operational overhead each approach carries. On the VM side, I had to manually install MySQL, edit configuration files, change the bind-address, restart services, open firewall ports, and create a remote user. The managed instance was simpler in terms of setup, but still required configuring SQL users, assigning privileges, adding my public IP under Authorized Networks, and navigating the GCP dashboard and Cloud Shell tools. Both setups required connecting through VS Code using SQLAlchemy, loading environment variables, and validating the full pipeline by creating a database, table, and reading back data.

Along the way, I ran into numerous bugs and errors in both environments that slowed down progress. VS Code repeatedly threw authentication and permission errors because the database users weren’t granted the correct privileges, the host didn't match, or the bind-address wasn’t set correctly. On the managed side, I hit the 1045 and 1044 access errors over and over until I realized I needed explicit GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON assignment4.* TO 'anthonym'@'%'. On the VM, simple mistakes like forgetting to restart MySQL after config edits or not updating the firewall caused SQLAlchemy failures. Switching between devices (PC vs Mac) also created mismatched environments and required me to reset credentials and reinstall dependencies multiple times.

One of the biggest pain points was the VM’s SSH workflow where every time the session closed or timed out, I had to reopen SSH, re-authenticate, and restart any command-line work to access MySQL again. This became tedious, especially compared to Cloud SQL, which let me manage the instance entirely through the console without needing SSH. After experiencing all of this, I would choose a VM only if cost was the priority, since it’s cheaper but requires more manual work. For a departmental analytics database, Cloud SQL is the better option because it’s more stable and easier to maintain. For a HIPAA-aligned workload, the clear choice is Cloud SQL because it supports encryption, automated backups, IAM, and a BAA, while the VM approach creates too much room for human error and misconfiguration.
